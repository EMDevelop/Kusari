## Team Instructions

#### Creating a requirements.txt file

You need to go to the root repository, and run the following:

```
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

If we add any dependencies, we will need to run the above statement again.

#### To then run

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/EMDevelop/investment-tracker.git`
- Enter the repo: `cd investment-tracker`
- Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv env`
- Activate the virtual environment: `source env/bin/activate`
- Install dependencies from the requirements: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- You might need to upgrade your pip: `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip`
