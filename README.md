## Creating A Django API App

I think we should have 1 app per Blockchain or Centralised Exchange (as we add them), and also one for general price fetching.

- prices (general)
- Bitcoin (Blockchain)
- Ethereum (Blockchain)
- Cardano (Blockchain)
- Polkadot (Blockchain)
- Binance (Centralised Exchange)
- Coinbase (Centralised Exchange)
- Kraken (Centralised Exchange)

#### Creating A New App

You will need to:

- open the terminal
- navigate to the relevant folder where your app lives, e.g. `cd backend/crypto`
- create a new App using: `python3 manage.py startapp prices`
  - `prices` is the name of the app

#### Front End instructions

- When we add abilities for a new chain, we need to update a prop in the 2 places the dropdown is usedwith the backend route:
  - frontend/src/components/multipleInputs/MultipleInputs.jsx
  - frontend/src/components/routes/LookupWallet/LookupWallet.jsx

#### File Structure

- Server
  - Where we will configure new routes for our front end to interact with
  - see backend/server/urls.py
- Crypto
  - This is where we will store our API's for crypto
  - 1 App per chain
- Traditional - This is where we will store our APIs for traditional services
  - Unsure on how to structure this - David?

#### Testing

To run Django tests:

- Navigate to the backend and run `./manage.py test crypto`
